          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two months after their
            <a href="#explosion">deadly attack</a> on Mako Reactor Number 1 that
            cost countless lives and left Sector 1 in ruins, Shinra police say
            that the terrorist group '<a href="#avalanche">Avalanche</a>' has
            been spotted infiltrating the perimeter of Mako Reactor Number 5. An
            alert has been sent out to all residents of Sector 5 to evacuate the
            premises immediately. President Shinra has urged citizens not to
            panic and to listen to local authorities for evacuation protocol.
            The military group <a href="#enlist-now">SOLDIER</a> has been
            disbatched to the area to assist security forces with the
            insurgents.

        </div>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shinra Security Forces have identintified a suspect
          who they believe to be in charge of the terrorist group 'Avalanche'
          that was responsible for last months attack on Mako Reactor Number 1.
          If you see this man please alert local authorities.
        </p>

        <p>Head of Public Safety, Heidegger, had this to say:</p>

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have long suspected that an attack on one of our
          cherished Mako Reactors may be imminent, though we had hoped that such
          evil plots would never come to fruition. The health and safety of the
          citizens of Midgar is of the utmost importance and we will exhaust our
          every resource to ensure that those responsible for this 'heinous' act
          will be held responsible. Turks intelligence, as well as anonymous
          informants, have led us to believe that this terrorist group may be
          operating out of the Sector 7 Slums."
        </p>

        <p>
          A reward of <strong>G</strong>10,000 is being offered for any
          information regarding the suspects whereabouts.

        <h6>EXPLOSION AT MAKO REACTOR</h6>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 2:37 am this morning an explosion occured at Mako
          Reactor Number 1. The cause of the incident is still under
          investigation but authorities suspect that this may have been a
          pre-meditated attack. Though malfunctions at Mako Reactors have
          happened in the past, officials state that an accident of this
          magnitude is 'highly unlikey'. The number of casualties has not yet
          been confirmed but is expected to be in the thousands.
        </p>
        <p>Head of Urban Development, Reeve, had this to say:</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Efforts to rebuild Mako Reactor Number 1 will begin
          immediately. However, right now I believe it is more important for us
          to come together as a community; to help those affected by this
          terrible tragedy and to send condolences to those who have lost loved
          ones."
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power outages may affect Sector 1 and the
          surrounding areas for the weeks to come and President Shinra asks the
          public for patience and understanding while he addresses this issue.
