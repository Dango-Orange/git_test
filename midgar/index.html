            <ul>
                <li><i>EYA 1971</i> - First year of Midgar construction. After a Mako hotspot is discovered, Shinra
                    begins
                    work by building a wall around the area's perimeter to ensure safe and efficient construction.
                    Construction starts on Mako
                    Reactor 0 to supply energy for the project.</li>
                <br>
                <li><i>EYA 1972</i> - Mako Reactor 0 becomes operational in the center of the contruction area.</li>
                <br>
                <li><i>EYA 1974</i> - The Midgar perimeter and Mako Reactor 1 are completed. Sped up by the operation of
                    Mako Reactor 0, construction concentrates on ensuring safety of workers and generation of energy.
                    More ground is leveled, leaving behind rocks and parts of foundation that were difficult to move.
                    This leads to an influx of workers and the establishment of lodgings that would become the basis of
                    the Midgar Undercity.</li>
                <br>
                <li><i>EYA 1975</i> - The Midgar train system and Sector 1 upper plate are completed. The train system
                    facilitates more effectient movement of goods and people, accelerating construction of additional
                    portions of the upper plate. Mako Reactors 2 and 3 are completed.</li>
                <br>
                <li><i>EYA 1976</i> - Mako Reactors 4 through 8 are completed and migration to the upper plate is in
                    full swing, supported by the bountiful supply of energy being generated. </li>
                <br>
                <li><i>EYA 1977</i> - Construction of Midgar is complete and Shinra relocates headquarters to the center
                    of Sector 0. The population of the city increases rapidly as a result of large scale efforts to
                    attract immigration and the cities abundance of opportunity.</li>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>idgar's primary mode of industry is as an energy supplier through the Shinra
            Electric Power Company's Mako Reactors. These reactors handle both the extraction of Mako energy from deep
            within the earths core and the distrubution of energy to their surrounding sectors and to neighboring towns
            and villages. The maintenance and operation of these reactors is the single biggest provider of employment
            throughout the city of Midgar and is the largest source of its economy.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>he Sector 7 Shinra Employee Housing Area <i>(pictured above)</i>  is a suburban residential area comprising perfectly planned suburbs where Shinra corporate employees are located. It is a town comprised of stone and wooden houses and larger apartment buildings along its roads. The town is located behind walls and beneath large bridges that connect to the spectacular Shinra Building, which can be seen clearly from the town. As with other topside sectors of Midgar, Sector 7 is a residential district for the middle and upper classes. It has a high standard of living, and a carefully managed population with balanced age demographics. While all Sectors provide a high quality of life, Sector 7 stands out in particular as it is a designated area for Shinra employees, where employees appear to be assigned houses, and military members can sign up for a house in the sector through a lottery system.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>he primary mode of transportation throughout Midgar is actually one of the
            cities oldest infrastructures: <i>an extensive railway system</i>. Each sector of Midgar has its own train
            station, making a total of eight stations used by passengers to embark and disembark at various points in
            the city proper. The system operates on Midgar Standard Time, and is run through the city's upper plate and
            linked to the Undercity via a giant cirular track that spirals around the city's central pillar known as the
            "Corkscrew Tunnel". These rail systems are heavily monitored by the city's security system, with security
            checkpoints along the routes used to automatically scan the passenger's ID cards to ensure the safety of all
            riders. Train services operate from 5:13 am to 1:35 am.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>n the Upper Plate there is also a sprawling highway system which is used
            primarily for local travel and delivery of goods and services. Although not as fast as the railway system,
            some citizens still prefer to use them for the scenic cityscape views that can only be seen from up above
            Midgar. Security forces also use these highways to transport military personal and equipment to all sectors
            to ensure the safety of their citizens.
